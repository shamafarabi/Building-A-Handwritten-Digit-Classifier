# Building-A-Handwritten-Digit-Classifier
This repository contains the code for classifying images of handwritten digits using different machine learning and Neural Network models. The idea behind this project was to understand how to implement image classification in machine learning while exploring the advantages and limitations of different conventional and neural network models. 

# Outline of Approach
Using  a dataset of images available  from sklearn.datasets, classification is first performed with a conventional approach such as K Nearest Neighbors. During this step, modeling was attempted with different values of K(i.e. number of nearest neighbors) to check how tuning this parameter affects the prediction accuracy by the model. Next, classification of the images with  neural network model is implement  by tuning some of the modeling paramters . (e.g. the number of neurons in a hidden layer using single and the number of hidden layers in the model).
