# Building-A-Handwritten-Digit-Classifier
This program explores the accuracy for classifying images of handwritten digits using different machine learning and Neural Network models. 
In this preliminary version KNN is attempted with different values of k(i.e. number of nearest neighbors), and then neural network is explored 
using single or multiple hidden layers and different number of neurons in the layer.
